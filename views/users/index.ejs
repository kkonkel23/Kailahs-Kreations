  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    As the daughter of an avid woodworker and crafting Queen, the path to woodburning came as no surprise. Growing up on Eastern Long Island surrounded by farm land, I sought out many creative outlets throughout my youth. Such as yarn bracelets, knitting, crocheting, and making various items from duct tape. My woodburning journey started when I wanted to make a custom gift for my Father for Christmas. As I searched Pinterest for ideas I came across a wood piece with a quote burned into it. I immeadiately knew that's what I wanted to do and I haven't looked back since.

    Aside from woodburning, I also enjoy playing with my animals and fishing in my spare time.
